**Dotfiles of my AwesomeWM configuration**

this only includes the most basic files to replicate my setup, such as 

+ configs for awesome
+ configs for alacritty
+ configs for rofi (straight-up stolen from [here](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi))
+ an edited version of [pijulius' picom fork](https://github.com/pijulius/picom)
+ configs for polybar
+ spicetify (still wip)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>before using any of the files, make sure to have at least the most necessary software installed, unless you know what you're doing:

basic stuff: `awesome rofi polybar nitrogen alacritty nemo amixer ksnip neovim`

all folders inside `belongs_in_config` belong, as the name implies, in the **.config** folder inside your `/home` directory. 
the fonts should be copied into `/usr/share/fonts/` for them to work properly, as they are required by *alacritty* and *polybar*

**the fancy-looking terminal programs I adore:

+moc(music on console), with the darkdot theme (available through most package-managers)
+[pipes.sh](https://github.com/pipeseroni/pipes.sh)
+[cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava)
+neofetch(no instructions necessary)

**Notes related to AwesomeWM**

all basic keybinds can be looked up by pressing `super + s`
